used core motion so you may need to install it on your iPhone.
i thought this would only take me like 4 hours as i havenâ€™t touched Xcode or swift since January. hehe. but ended up taking me about 7, i challenged myself to learn core motion and ran into a few road blocks during implementation but google-fu and getting help saved the day. always read the docs!
